## **Breathing Patterns**

#### **1) Box / Square Breathing** (Intermediate, Focus)

**Purpose:** Anxiety control, ADHD focus, pre-performance calming, emotional regulation, stress management, tactical breathing, attention training.
Equal phases → strong cognitive control and rhythm.
**Patterns:**
3–3–3–3, 4–4–4–4, 5–5–5–5, 6–6–6–6

---

#### **2) Equal Inhale–Exhale (No Holds)** (Beginner, Calm)

**Purpose:** Relaxation, HRV coherence, gentle parasympathetic activation, beginner-friendly breathing.
Also called coherent breathing (especially 5–5 or 6–6).
**Patterns:**
3–0–3–0, 4–0–4–0, 5–0–5–0, 6–0–6–0

---

#### **3) Equal Inhale–Exhale with Inhale Hold** (Intermediate, Mindfulness)

**Purpose:** Breath awareness, mindfulness, attention training, mild CO₂ tolerance.
Short inhale holds add structure without strain.
**Patterns:**
3–3–3–0, 4–4–4–0, 5–5–5–0, 6–6–6–0

---

#### **4) Equal Inhale–Exhale with Exhale Hold** (Intermediate, Calm)

**Purpose:** Calming, CO₂ tolerance. Exhale hold increases vagal tone and stillness.
**Patterns:**
3–0–3–3, 4–0–4–4, 5–0–5–5, 6–0–6–6

---

#### **5) Extended Exhale (No Holds)** (Beginner/Intermediate, Relaxation & Sleep)

**Purpose:** Strong relaxation, anxiety reduction, down-regulation, sleep onset.
Exhale longer than inhale → parasympathetic dominance, effective for acute stress.
**Patterns:**
2–0–6–0, 3–0–6–0, 4–0–6–0, 4–0–8–0

---

#### **6) Inhale-Hold Emphasis (Structured Relaxation)** (Intermediate, Breath Control)

**Purpose:** Breath control, anxiety exposure, rhythm discipline.
Short holds add structure without long breath suspensions.
**Patterns:**
4–2–4–0, 4–2–6–0

---

#### **7) Extended Exhale after Inhale Hold** (Intermediate/Advanced, Calm & Sleep)

**Purpose:** Deep calming, insomnia support, panic reduction.
Slow exhale after hold strongly activates the parasympathetic system.
**Patterns:**
4–4–8–0, 4–7–8–0 (Weil breathing)

---

#### **8) Fast Energising Breathing** (Beginner/Intermediate, Energise)

**Purpose:** Increase alertness, counter fatigue, pre-task activation.
Fast, no-hold breathing raises arousal and focus by increasing respiratory rate. Best used briefly, not for relaxation.
**Patterns:**
2–0–2–0, 2–0–3–0

---

#### **9) Two-Stage Inhale (Physiological Sigh)** (Intermediate, Rapid Calm)

**Purpose:** Rapid calming, anxiety interruption, nervous system reset.
Double inhale followed by a long exhale improves lung inflation and strongly activates calming pathways. Most effective in a few cycles.
**Patterns:**
2–1–6–0, 3–1–6–0

---

#### **10) Long Exhale-Hold Tolerance** (Advanced, Breath Control & Calm)

**Purpose:** CO₂ tolerance, deep parasympathetic conditioning, breath control.
Exhale pause trains calm responses to air hunger and deepens regulation. Best for experienced users.
**Patterns:**
4–0–4–4, 4–0–6–6, 4–0–6–8

# **Types of Breathing**
There are different modes of breathing, each with a slightly different process for inspiration and expiration.

#### **1) Quiet breathing** (Eupnea):

 occurs at rest without thought. The diaphragm and external intercostals contract.
Normal rates for adults are typically between 12 and 20 breaths per minute.

#### **2) Diaphragmatic breathing** (belly breathing):

the diaphragm contracts as the belly moves out, keeping the chest still. As the diaphragm relaxes, air passively leaves the lungs.

#### **3)Costal breathing** (shallow chest breathing):
occurs via contraction of the intercostal muscles. As the intercostal muscles relax, air passively leaves the lungs.

#### **4) Hyperpnea** (forced breathing):
 inspiration and expiration both occur due to contraction of the diaphragm, intercostal muscles, and other accessory muscles. During forced inspiration, muscles of the neck, including the scalenes, contract and lift the thoracic wall, increasing lung volume. During forced expiration, accessory muscles of the abdomen, including the obliques, contract, forcing abdominal organs upward against the diaphragm. This helps to push the diaphragm further into the thorax, pushing more air out. In addition, accessory muscles (primarily the internal intercostals) help to compress the rib cage, which also reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity.
